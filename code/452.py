# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

# There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space.
# For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal,
# y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice.
# Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
#
# An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis.
# A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart â‰¤ x â‰¤ xend.
# There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely.
# The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
#
# Example:
# Input: [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
# One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6])
# and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
