# 338. Counting Bits
# Given a non negative integer number num.
# For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation
# and return them as an array.

# Example:
# For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
#
# Follow up:
#
# It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)).
# But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
# Space complexity should be O(n).
# Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function
# like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
